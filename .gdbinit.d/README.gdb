# Contrary to gdb-dashboard usage guide, gdb-dashboard itself is sourced
# from ~/.gdbinit (instead of being installed as ~/.gdbinit), thus we can
# still include common GDB configuration in ~/.gdbinit.
#
# Given that all files in ~/.gdbinit.d are sourced by gdb-dashboard,
# we will be using ~/.gdbinit.d strictly for gdb-dashboard customizations.
